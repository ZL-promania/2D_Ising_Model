# 2D Ising Model

Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model using Metropolis and Wolff algorithms.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a group project for a computational physics course, focusing on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model.

We study equilibrium properties, autocorrelation effects, critical slowing down, finite-size behavior, and non-equilibrium dynamics across the thermal phase transition by implementing and comparing two Monte Carlo algorithms:

- Metropolis single-spin update
- Wolff cluster update

## Physics Background

The two-dimensional Ising model consists of spins \( s_i = \pm 1 \) on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions,

\[
H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j ,
\]

and exhibits a continuous phase transition at the exact critical temperature

\[
k_B T_c = \frac{2J}{\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}.
\]

The model serves as a benchmark system for studying critical phenomena and validating Monte Carlo simulation techniques.

## Monte Carlo Algorithms

### Metropolis Algorithm

The Metropolis algorithm performs local single-spin flips that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the Boltzmann distribution.  
It correctly reproduces equilibrium thermodynamic observables but suffers from strong critical slowing down near the critical temperature.

The implementation and analysis are split into two parts:

- **`Metropolis.py`**  
  Core implementation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, including lattice initialization, single-spin updates, and basic observable measurements.

- **`drawing.ipynb`**  
  Analysis and visualization based on Metropolis simulations, including autocorrelation time estimation, temperature dependence of observables, and finite-size effects.

### Wolff Cluster Algorithm

The Wolff algorithm performs non-local cluster updates based on the Fortuin–Kasteleyn representation.  
By flipping correlated spin clusters in a single update, it significantly reduces autocorrelation times near criticality.

The Wolff-related code is organized as:

- **`wolff ising.py`**  
  Core implementation of the Wolff cluster algorithm, including cluster construction, equilibrium measurements, and linear annealing protocols.

- **`drawing_wolff.py`**  
  Post-processing and visualization for Wolff simulations, including temperature-dependent observables, autocorrelation analysis, and comparisons with Metropolis results.

## Measured Observables

From Monte Carlo time series generated by both algorithms, we compute:

- Energy per spin  
- Magnetization (absolute value)  
- Susceptibility  
- Binder cumulant  
- Integrated autocorrelation time  

Autocorrelation times are used to quantify sampling efficiency and to demonstrate critical slowing down in local updates and its suppression by cluster updates.

## Finite-Size Effects and Annealing

Simulations are performed on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions for multiple lattice sizes \( L \).

- Finite-size effects are analyzed by comparing magnetization and energy curves across different system sizes.
- Linear annealing simulations using the Wolff algorithm are implemented to study non-equilibrium relaxation and the effect of cooling rate.
